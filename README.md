<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orange">**Note**</span> : KMRemote is a WordPress theme.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orange">**Note**</span>: Build for a tablet for my own use. At this time, this will not work properly on a phone or on desktop browser. This will be improved... see plan below.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orange">**Note**</span>: At this time, there is no security layer in KMRemote. Every one having access to you LAN would be abble to launch Keyboard Maestro macros on your Mac... This would be added as an option in future version... see Plan below.

## Installation and Access on Lan

Assuming that you have a working local install of WordPress running (with [MAMP PRO](https://www.mamp.info), [Local](https://local.getflywheel.com), build-in macOS AMP, ...) on the mac, you need to access to the webapp via LAN.
<br>
<br>
Just install and activate the KMRemote theme in WordPress as any other.
<br>
<br>
To access remotely to the webapp from LAN really depends on your local web environment. 

With [MAMP PRO](https://www.mamp.info), you can :
- use Xip.io ([info](https://documentation-3.mamp.info/en/documentation/mamp-pro/#4.2.1-General-Settings-Host), [Xip](http://xip.io))
- set IP/Port to */80 and add *yourcomputername.local* as alias. Use *yourcomputername.local* remotely.

This tools may be useful :

* [Squidman](http://squidman.net/squidman/) proxy server
* [Hosts](http://permanentmarkers.nl/software.html) preference pane to manage host file
